Abstractions:

 - Camera
   * Taking a picture
     - dimensions
     - grayscale/color
   * Taking a video
     - frame rate
     
 - Image
   * Metadata for image:
     - dimensions
     - number of channels (rgb, grayscale, etc...)
 
 - Communication
   * Communicating with the router card of the robot
   * Receive gyroscope information
   * Send 
   
 - Transformation
   * Algorithm that modifies an image
   * A transformation should be able to employ another transformation
   * Examples:
     - Convert to grayscale
     - Cropping
     - Transpose
     - Seam Carving

 - Robot Position
   * orientation of the robot (based on gyroscope)

 - Obstacle
   * spatial position
   * size
   
 - Route
   * list of positions/waypoints for the robot to got to

 - MappingSytem
   * Converts 2D image coordinates into 3D coordinates relative to the robot's position/orientation
   
 - GUI for Testing/Experimentation
   * include interface for loading a image from file
   * real-time experimentation with parameter values
 
 - FileManager
   * loading images (various types) from file system
   * saving images (various types) to file system
